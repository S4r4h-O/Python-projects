# Still in development stage

TODO:

- [x] Fix multiple checkboxes selection. Error:
```
streamlit.errors.StreamlitDuplicateElementId: There are multiple button elements with the same auto-generated ID. When this element is created, it is assigned an internal ID based on the element type and provided parameters. Multiple elements with the same type and parameters will cause this error.
```

- [ ] Remove the hardcoded parameters

- [x] Add verification of existence of the txt files

- [ ] Functions should have a class
